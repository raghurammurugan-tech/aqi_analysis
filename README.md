# 🌫️ Air Quality Risk Analysis & Air Purifier Market Assessment (India)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes air quality, pollution severity, health impact, and emission indicators across Indian states to identify regions with critical air pollution exposure and assess where air purifiers are most urgently required.

The project emphasizes real-world data handling, showcasing how high-volume, messy datasets were cleaned using **Microsoft Excel** and then analyzed using **SQL** to generate actionable business insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify states with the worst and best air quality  
- Quantify pollution severity distribution  
- Detect seasonal pollution trends  
- Analyze dominant pollutants  
- Examine health burden and vehicle impact  
- Translate insights into market and product strategy  

---

## 📂 Data Scope
The analysis is based on:
- State-wise and time-based AQI records  
- AQI severity category distributions  
- Monthly AQI trends  
- Pollutant concentration data (PM2.5, PM10, gases)  
- Disease case counts by state  
- Vehicle registration volumes by state
⚠️ All insights are strictly derived from the obtained datasets.

The combined data volume spans **hundreds of thousands of rows per dataset**, crossing **over one million records in total**.

## 📊 Data Source
The datasets used in this project were provided as part of a resume project challenge hosted on **Codebasics.io**, with data sponsored by **Dataful**.

All data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis, and insights were independently performed as part of this project.

## 🧪 Methodology
- Cleaned and validated high-volume datasets using Microsoft Excel  
- Standardized schemas and prepared data for database ingestion  
- Imported cleaned data into SQL for analysis  
- Performed aggregations, classifications, and trend analysis  
- Derived business insights from pollution, health, and vehicle indicators

## 📊 Key Business Insights
- Air pollution exposure in India is **geographically concentrated**, with northern states consistently recording higher AQI levels.
- Pollution severity shows **strong seasonality**, with winter months driving peak exposure and health risk.
- **PM2.5 and PM10** are the dominant contributors to poor air quality across high-risk regions.
- States with high population and vehicle density exhibit **sustained pollution pressure**, indicating long-term mitigation needs.
- Health burden patterns highlight increased vulnerability in densely populated states, reinforcing the need for preventive solutions.

Together, these insights indicate that air purifier demand in India is **region-specific, seasonal, and driven by persistent exposure rather than isolated events**.
