## Q1. Which states experience the worst air quality?

| Rank | State | Average AQI |
|-----:|------|------------:|
| 1 | Delhi | 215.90 |
| 2 | Bihar | 165.91 |
| 3 | Himachal Pradesh | 160.13 |
| 4 | Uttar Pradesh | 159.54 |
| 5 | Haryana | 151.53 |

**Insight:**  
Air pollution exposure is heavily concentrated in **northern states**, with Delhi showing **extreme and persistent AQI levels**.

**Business Meaning:**  
These states represent **high-priority regions** where air quality mitigation solutions are most urgently required.

---

## Q2. Which states have the cleanest air quality?

| Rank | State | Average AQI |
|-----:|------|------------:|
| 1 | Mizoram | 45.06 |
| 2 | Meghalaya | 52.62 |
| 3 | Sikkim | 53.47 |
| 4 | Puducherry | 55.96 |
| 5 | Arunachal Pradesh | 59.86 |

**Insight:**  
North-Eastern and coastal regions consistently maintain **healthy air quality levels**.

**Business Meaning:**  
These regions are **low-priority markets** for pollution-mitigation products and require awareness-based approaches rather than necessity-driven solutions.

---

## Q3. How severe is air pollution overall in India?

| AQI Category | Number of Days |
|-------------|--------------:|
| Good | 69,759 |
| Satisfactory | 155,296 |
| Moderate | 138,696 |
| Poor | 44,063 |
| Very Poor | 15,573 |
| Severe | 2,584 |

**Insight:**  
Nearly **20% of all recorded days** fall under *Poor or worse* AQI categories.

**Business Meaning:**  
Air pollution is not an occasional event but a **recurring and chronic issue**, supporting sustained demand for indoor air-quality solutions.

---

## Q4. Are pollution levels seasonal?

### Worst AQI Months
| Month | Avg AQI |
|------|--------:|
| November | 174.44 |
| December | 168.38 |
| January | 163.35 |

### Best AQI Months
| Month | Avg AQI |
|------|--------:|
| August | 66.29 |
| July | 67.51 |
| September | 70.49 |

**Insight:**  
Pollution levels peak consistently during **winter months** and improve significantly during monsoon periods.

**Business Meaning:**  
Demand for mitigation solutions is **predictable and seasonal**, enabling better planning for inventory, campaigns, and resource allocation.

---

## Q5. Which pollutants contribute most to poor air quality?

**Observation:**  
Across high-AQI states:
- **PM2.5 and PM10** are the dominant contributors  
- Gaseous pollutants (NO₂, CO, O₃) act as secondary amplifiers

**Business Meaning:**  
Mitigation efforts should primarily focus on **particulate matter reduction**, as it drives the majority of unhealthy AQI readings.

---

## Q6. Which states show the highest disease burden?

| State | Total Reported Cases |
|------|---------------------:|
| West Bengal | 243,847 |
| Maharashtra | 226,312 |
| Karnataka | 129,722 |
| Uttar Pradesh | 89,703 |
| Madhya Pradesh | 84,248 |

**Insight:**  
High-population states account for a **disproportionate share of disease burden**.

**Business Meaning:**  
Regions with higher population density and pollution exposure may benefit more from **preventive environmental health interventions**.

---

## Q7. What types of illnesses are most common?

| Illness Category | Total Cases |
|-----------------|------------:|
| Water-borne | 563,822 |
| Vector-borne | 432,231 |
| Food-borne | 230,616 |
| Respiratory | 4,055 |

**Insight:**  
Respiratory cases are fewer in number but often **higher in severity and long-term impact**.

**Business Meaning:**  
Air quality plays a **risk-amplifying role** in respiratory health outcomes, supporting the case for preventive exposure reduction.

---

## Q8. Does vehicle density align with pollution exposure?

| State | Registered Vehicles (Millions) |
|------|-------------------------------:|
| Uttar Pradesh | 33.8 |
| Maharashtra | 26.8 |
| Tamil Nadu | 20.2 |
| Gujarat | 17.8 |
| Karnataka | 17.6 |

**Insight:**  
States with high vehicle density frequently overlap with **high-AQI regions**.

**Business Meaning:**  
Transport emissions contribute to **sustained pollution pressure**, reinforcing long-term mitigation needs rather than short-term fixes.

---

## 🔎 Overall Synthesis
- Pollution exposure is **regionally concentrated**, not uniform  
- Severity is **seasonal but persistent**  
- Particulate matter is the **primary risk driver**  
- Population and vehicle density amplify exposure impact  

**Conclusion:**  
Air quality risk in India is **predictable, data-driven, and geographically clustered**, enabling targeted, evidence-based decision-making.
